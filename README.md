This project focuses on creating a real-time system for detecting marine debris using the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm. Marine debris, including plastics and other pollutants, poses a significant threat to aquatic ecosystems. The system is designed to efficiently identify and classify debris from video feeds, providing a practical solution for environmental monitoring.

YOLOv8â€™s high-speed and accurate detection capabilities ensure reliable performance in real-world scenarios. The project aims to assist researchers and organizations in tracking and mitigating marine debris in oceans, rivers, and coastal areas.

Future enhancements include integrating the system with drones or autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to extend its usability in larger and more challenging environments. This innovative approach holds promise for improving marine conservation efforts and contributing to cleaner waterways.
